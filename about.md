I'm a math student in the University of Campinas (UNICAMP). 

### Linux specs

I use to hop around Linux distros a lot, but for now I'm checking out Manjaro. It's was been a good experince so far! My current graphical environment is bspwm with Polybar, you can check out my config files on my Github page.
